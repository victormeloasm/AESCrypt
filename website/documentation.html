            <h2>Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AES-256-GCM Encryption:</strong> AES-256-GCM is a widely recognized encryption standard used for secure data encryption. The GCM mode provides additional integrity checks, making encrypted data both confidential and tamper-proof.</li>
                <li><strong>Password Hashing with Argon2id:</strong> Argon2id offers exceptional protection against brute-force and side-channel attacks, making it one of the most secure password hashing algorithms available.</li>
                <li><strong>Secure File Deletion:</strong> Ensures that files are securely deleted from the disk by overwriting them with random data multiple times, preventing file recovery by unauthorized parties.</li>
                <li><strong>Metadata Encryption:</strong> Protects not only the contents of your files but also their metadata, such as filenames, timestamps, and file sizes, which could otherwise leak information.</li>
                <li><strong>Batch Encryption:</strong> Encrypt multiple files or entire directories in one go, saving time and enhancing productivity when dealing with numerous sensitive files.</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-Platform Compatibility:</strong> Available for both Windows and Linux systems, ensuring that users across different platforms can benefit from the tool.</li>
                <li><strong>Modern User Interface:</strong> A sleek, dark-themed GUI that reduces eye strain while making it easy to navigate through the encryption and decryption process.</li>
                <li><strong>Random Password Generation:</strong> Generate strong, random passwords with a click, ensuring robust encryption without the risk of weak passwords.</li>
                <li><strong>Random Byte Injection:</strong> Introduces random data into encrypted files, obscuring the original file size and making it more difficult for attackers to identify encrypted files based on their size.</li>
                <li><strong>Memory Management Improvements:</strong> Sensitive data such as encryption keys and passwords are securely erased from memory once they're no longer needed, ensuring that they cannot be leaked.</li>
                <li><strong>Anti-Keylogger Protection:</strong> With integrated measures to block keyloggers, AESCrypt helps to prevent your passwords from being intercepted by malicious software during encryption and decryption.</li>
            </ul>
