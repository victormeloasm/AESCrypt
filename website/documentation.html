            <h2>Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AES-256-GCM Encryption:</strong> The program uses AES-256-GCM, a symmetric encryption algorithm known for its high security and support for authenticated encryption, ensuring that data is both confidential and tamper-proof.</li>
                <li><strong>Password Hashing with Argon2id:</strong> This password hashing technique offers exceptional resistance against brute force and side-channel attacks, making it one of the most secure options available.</li>
                <li><strong>Secure File Deletion:</strong> When files are deleted, they are overwritten with random data multiple times, preventing their recovery by unauthorized parties.</li>
                <li><strong>Metadata Encryption:</strong> AESCrypt protects not only the content of the files but also metadata, such as file names and modification times, which are often overlooked during encryption processes.</li>
                <li><strong>Batch Encryption:</strong> Encrypt multiple files or an entire folder with a single action, improving both speed and efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-Platform Compatibility:</strong> Available on both Windows and Linux, ensuring users on different platforms can benefit from its capabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced User Interface:</strong> A modern, sleek GUI that provides an intuitive experience, especially with its dark theme that reduces eye strain during long sessions.</li>
                <li><strong>Random Password Generation:</strong> Generate strong, random passwords for encryption and decryption, ensuring that weak passwords are never an issue.</li>
                <li><strong>Random Byte Addition:</strong> Introduces random data into encrypted files to obscure their size and make it more difficult to identify encrypted files based on their file size.</li>
                <li><strong>Memory Management Improvements:</strong> The application ensures that sensitive data, such as passwords and encryption keys, are securely erased from memory after use, preventing potential data leakage.</li>
                <li><strong>Anti-Keylogger Protection:</strong> AESCrypt integrates advanced techniques to prevent keyloggers from capturing sensitive data such as passwords during encryption and decryption processes. By using secure input methods and memory isolation, the program reduces the risk of keylogging attacks, ensuring that user credentials remain safe from external threats.</li>
