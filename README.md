## Overview

**AESCrypt Argon 7.0AK REV** builds on the secure foundations of Argon 6.5AK by introducing enhanced per-block encryption, increased performance through multithreading, and greater resilience against tampering and unauthorized access. This version introduces an entirely revamped architecture for handling large files, with individual encryption and authentication for each block.

By combining **Argon2**, the most secure password hashing algorithm, with **AES-256**, a gold standard in encryption, **AESCrypt 7.0AK REV** provides the ultimate assurance that your files remain private and untouchable. Designed with an intuitive graphical interface and fortified with Anti-Keylogger (AK) protections, it is a must-have tool for anyone concerned about cybersecurity.

## Key Features

### Robust Security
- **AES-256 Encryption**: Files are encrypted using the most trusted encryption algorithm.
- **Argon2 Password Hashing**: Passwords are hashed using high memory and computational costs to thwart brute-force attacks.
- **Per-Block IVs and Tags**: Each 1MB block has its own Initialization Vector (IV) and authentication tag, ensuring granular encryption and tamper detection.
- **HMAC Verification**: Expanded HMAC validation secures file integrity by authenticating all IVs, tags, and encrypted data.

### Advanced Functionality
- **Multithreading**: Both encryption and decryption operations leverage multiple CPU cores for enhanced speed, particularly for large files.
- **File Integrity Check**: Calculate and display SHA-256 checksums before and after encryption to ensure file integrity.
- **Secure Deletion**: Deletes files by overwriting them multiple times with random data, making recovery impossible.
- **Large File Compatibility**: Optimized to process files of any size seamlessly.

### User Experience
- **Dark Mode Interface**: Fully revamped GUI featuring a modern dark theme for a sleek and comfortable user experience.
- **Virtual Keyboard**: Protects against keyloggers by allowing secure password input through an on-screen keyboard with randomized layouts.
- **Password Management**: Generate secure, random passwords and toggle password visibility with ease.

## New in 7.0AK REV

### Major Improvements
1. **Per-Block Encryption**:
   - Each block (1MB) of a file now has a unique IV and authentication tag.
   - Enhances data security and tamper resistance, making it impossible to modify even a single block without detection.
   
2. **Expanded HMAC Validation**:
   - Validates IVs, tags, and encrypted data as a unified entity.
   - Prevents tampering or corruption of any part of the file during transmission or storage.

3. **Multithreaded Decryption**:
   - Fully parallelized decryption process handles blocks independently for optimal performance on modern CPUs.
   - Ideal for large files or batch decryption tasks.

4. **Memory and File Security**:
   - Uses **PyNaCl** for advanced secure memory erasure.
   - Improved file deletion with multi-pass overwrites (zeros, ones, random data).

5. **Enhanced Error Reporting**:
   - Provides detailed and actionable error messages for troubleshooting encryption or decryption issues.
