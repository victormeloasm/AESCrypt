## Overview

**AESCrypt 4.0 Argon** is a command-line and GUI-based tool designed for the encryption and decryption of files and folders. It leverages the Argon2id algorithm for secure password hashing and AES-256 for robust encryption. With a focus on security and ease of use, AESCrypt 4.0 Argon provides a streamlined solution for protecting your sensitive information.

## Features

- **File Encryption**: Encrypts individual files with AES-256 encryption using a secure, hashed password.
- **File Decryption**: Decrypts files previously encrypted with AESCrypt.
- **Batch Encryption**: Encrypts all files within a selected folder, simplifying bulk encryption tasks.
- **Random Byte Padding**: Automatically adds at least 1MB of random bytes to the encrypted files, disguising their actual size for enhanced security.
- **Password Generation**: Generates strong, random passwords for enhanced security.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Modern, dark-themed graphical user interface for an intuitive user experience.
- **No Console Window**: Operates without a console window, providing a clean and professional interface.
- **Secure File Deletion**: Overwrites original files with random data before deletion to prevent unauthorized recovery.
- **Metadata Encryption**: Protects sensitive file metadata from exposure.
- **HMAC for Integrity**: Utilizes HMAC to verify data integrity during encryption and decryption.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly across different operating systems.

## Usage

### Launching the Application

To start AESCrypt 4.0 Argon:

- **If Using Python**: Execute the script directly:
  ```bash
  python AESCrypt.py
  ```
- **If Compiled to Executable**: Double-click the `.exe` file generated by PyInstaller.

### User Interface Overview

The AESCrypt 4.0 Argon interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly:

- **File/Folder Path**: A text field and browse button to select files or folders for encryption or decryption.
- **Password Entry**: A field to input or generate a strong password.
- **Action Buttons**: Buttons to initiate encryption, decryption, or password generation.

### Encrypting Files

1. **Select a File**: Click on "Browse File" to choose the file you want to encrypt.
2. **Enter Password**: Type a secure password into the password field or click "Generate Password" to create a strong one.
3. **Encrypt**: Click the "Encrypt" button. The encrypted file will be saved with a `.aes` extension in the same location as the original file.

### Decrypting Files

1. **Select an Encrypted File**: Click on "Browse File" to choose the `.aes` file you wish to decrypt.
2. **Enter Password**: Provide the password used during the encryption process.
3. **Decrypt**: Click the "Decrypt" button. The decrypted file will be saved with its original filename, replacing the `.aes` extension.

### Encrypting Folders

1. **Select a Folder**: Click on "Browse Folder" to choose the folder containing files to encrypt.
2. **Enter Password**: Enter a password or generate a new one.
3. **Encrypt**: Click "Encrypt" to start the encryption process. All files within the selected folder will be encrypted.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **File Not Found**: Verify the file or folder path is correct and that you have the necessary permissions to access it.
- **Password Mismatch**: Ensure that the password you are using matches the one used during encryption.

### Error Messages

- **"File Integrity Check Failed"**: Indicates that the file might be corrupted or tampered with. Double-check the password and file integrity.

## Security Considerations

- **Password Management**: Always use strong, unique passwords for encryption. Avoid reusing passwords across different applications.
- **Data Handling**: Make sure files are properly managed and backed up to prevent accidental loss or corruption.
- **Environment**: Run the application in a secure environment and avoid using it on compromised systems.
