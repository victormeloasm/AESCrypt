The AESCrypt v1.0 interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly:

- **File/Folder Path**: A text field and browse button to select files or folders for encryption or decryption.
- **Password Entry**: A field to input or generate a strong password.
- **Action Buttons**: Buttons to initiate encryption, decryption, or password generation.

### Encrypting Files

1. **Select a File**: Click on "Browse File" to choose the file you want to encrypt.
2. **Enter Password**: Type a secure password into the password field or click "Generate Password" to create a strong one.
3. **Encrypt**: Click the "Encrypt" button. The encrypted file will be saved with a `.aes` extension in the same location as the original file.

### Decrypting Files

1. **Select an Encrypted File**: Click on "Browse File" to choose the `.aes` file you wish to decrypt.
2. **Enter Password**: Provide the password used during the encryption process.
3. **Decrypt**: Click the "Decrypt" button. The decrypted file will be saved with its original filename, replacing the `.aes` extension.

### Encrypting Folders

1. **Select a Folder**: Click on "Browse Folder" to choose the folder containing files to encrypt.
2. **Enter Password**: Enter a password or generate a new one.
3. **Encrypt**: Click "Encrypt" to start the encryption process. All files within the selected folder will be encrypted.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **File Not Found**: Verify the file or folder path is correct and that you have the necessary permissions to access it.
- **Password Mismatch**: Ensure that the password you are using matches the one used during encryption.

### Error Messages

- **"File Integrity Check Failed"**: Indicates that the file might be corrupted or tampered with. Double-check the password and file integrity.

## Security Considerations

- **Password Management**: Always use strong, unique passwords for encryption. Avoid reusing passwords across different applications.
- **Data Handling**: Make sure files are properly managed and backed up to prevent accidental loss or corruption.
- **Environment**: Run the application in a secure environment and avoid using it on compromised systems.
