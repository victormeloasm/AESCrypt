## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| **Antivirus detects AESCrypt** | Whitelist the application in your AV settings. It is a false positive. |
| **HMAC check failed** | Ensure you entered the **correct password**. The file may have been tampered with. |
| **File not found error** | Verify the file path and permissions. |

## 🔑 Security Notes

🔹 **Use strong passwords!** Encryption is only as strong as the password used.  
🔹 **Back up important files!** Encrypted data cannot be recovered without the password.  
🔹 **False Positives in Antivirus Software:** This is expected due to high-security encryption techniques.
